      <h2>Spencer See</h2>

      <p> Welcome to my personal data analytics portfolio from my City and Regional Planning studies to compliment my Landscape Architecture portfolio. As a dual masters student, I was often questioned on why I pursued a second masters in City and Regional Planning when Landscape Architects can fulfill that role proffesionally. My personal belief and focus in that program was the use of data analysis and developing both the hard and soft skills required not only to assess sites in more detail, but provide built environment interventions that could expand beyond the footprint of the design site. I believe more holistic aproaches to design and construction will be pivitol, leveraging the amount of data generated in the modern era as well as confronting the complex interdisciplinary nature of the challanges faced by society more directly in all scale of projects.</p>
      
      <p> This is a collection of projects which I have initated myself with no outside guidance when faced with challenges both from class projects and proffesional tasks. Although some of these data cleaning tasks and visualizations are simpler than my R related coursework projects, they were all applied to roadblocks that would have otherwised hindered the entire team involved who did not have the ability to move forward in GIS appications or Excel the way I could with R. All of these tasks greatly increased the capacity of the stakeholders involved to move on with further analysis and objectives, supporting my overall goal of developing these skills as an asset to interdisciplinary projects in my future career. The code in the github repository is annotated to show my process and application of critical thinking to gain the results we needed when applicable.</p>

        <p>This is a side project I decided to assist in outside of class or internship responsibilities. This project is a startup between a close friend and another practicing proffesional related to the Progressive Party of Ohio and strikes close to me given some of the personal struggles I have witnessed with the LGBTQ+ community and women alike in my state. Given the original two members expertise in Engineering and Political Science, I decided to assist in a generalist capacity as I have more experience in web native languages and automating spatial analysis tasks than the other two prototypers. This project is ongoing and is a way for me to learn rapidly in a fast paced environment while assisting in a social cause I feel passionate about. Along with expanding my R, HTML, and CSS skillset, I am also utilizing my knowledge gained from City and Regional Planning as well as multiple internships to add to conversation and consult in the overall direction of the project.</p>
